// ID Management -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The goal of ID Management is to ensure that at most a single SGWT object is assigned the
// same ID, and that if a SC object also uses that ID, it can only be the underlying/wrapped
// SC object for that SGWT object.  The overall system is designed so that:
//
// - When a SGWT object is created with new, so that there is no expected SC object with the
//   same ID, then we verify that and warn of a collision if either a SGWT or SC object already
//   has that ID.  Any collision will cause us to destroy() the old SGWT or SC object before
//   registering the new one.  The ID is auto-generated unless specified in the constructor,
//   and registered against the SGWT object - registration lasts until destroy() is called on
//   that object.
// 
// - A SC API is used to provide the SGWT auto-generated IDs, so SC will not try to use them,
//   but the SC side will have no knowledge of any manually set SGWT IDs before the underlying
//   SC object is created.  In this case, a collision will be detected only when the SC
//   object underlying the SGWT widget is created (say because it's drawn).
//
// - SC objects created by the SC JS Framework that have no SGWT presence will not be registered
//   in the SGWT ID Management table, but will still trigger a collision if an attempt is
//   made to register a SGWT widget with the same ID.
//
// - When a SGWT object is created from a live SC object, there is obviously no need to check
//   the SC side for ID collisions, but we still check for collisions against other SGWT
//   objects.  In this case the ID is provided by the SC object and is not generated or
//   settable.  -
//
// - If setID() is called on a SGWT object, we perform the same collision check as if new
//   had been called for that ID, and change the registered ID for that object.  If setID()
//   is called for a SGWT object that already has an underlying SC JS object, then
//   an exception is thrown as this is illegal.
//
//   When destroy() is called on either the SC or SGWT side, both objects will be destroy()ed
//   if both exist - SC objects can be created outside of SGWT, and SGWT objects may not have
//   created their underlying SC objects at the point when destroy is called.  Destroying a
//   SGWT object unregisters its ID and destroying a SC object removes the window[ID] binding.
//   If the ID is auto-generated, calling destroy() (whether both objects exist or just one on
//   the SC or SGWT side) will return it to the common free pool of auto-generated IDs.
